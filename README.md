# WDC Fall 2017 Meeting GitBook

Welcome to the WDC Fall 2017 Meeting GitBook! Here we'll set up all of the tutorials/links/resources needed for the Meetings!

## How this works

Every meeting we will talk about a new topic. Each meeting will build upon the last. Each meeting will have a list of resources. If you are unable to attend a meeting, you can take a look at this GitBook for more info.

## Goal

The Purdue Web Dev Club's mission is to introduce web to the Purdue community. 

By the end of the last meeting, you should have a finished web project.

## Project

This semester we will be writing a resume website from scratch! At the end of each meeting, we will have a portion of the project built. By the end of the last meeting, you should have your own resume website.

## Meeting Topics

* HTML & CSS
* Intro to JS
* Advanced JS topics
* Node.JS/Server-side development
* Async & Callback Hell
  
This is currently a WIP, but will be done soon!
